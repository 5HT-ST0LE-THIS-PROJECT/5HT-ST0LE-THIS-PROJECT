# @5HT is misappropriating projects he had nothing to do with

This person has made absolutely no effort to create the projects he pretends to be his own.<br>
All his activities are code theft, license violations, and authorship erasure. 

And there is plenty of evidence for this:

1) [A little investigation](https://gist.github.com/forked-from-1kasper/06d241303cc314b35c291c38e61a5e0c) by @forked-from-1kasper, who developed the [Anders](https://github.com/forked-from-1kasper/anders) typechecker, which was then brazenly embezzled by @5HT.

2) [An attempt to point out a bug in Anders project code](https://archive.fo/S7TjD) from his assigned repository that he can't fix, so he deleted all mention of it.

3) [The incident of his shameless copying of the "hx" editor code](https://web.archive.org/web/20220617154719/https://github.com/krpors/hx/issues/22) and complete disregard of the project's license, followed by wishes of reprisals against the author of the original code. Now he attacks random people on Twitter for their inability, as he says, [to write an editor and disassembler in 4 days.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220804061309/https://twitter.com/miaerpuno/status/1554880769402740737)

4) [Another dialogue with @5HT](https://web.archive.org/web/20220708050737/https://gist.github.com/AlexeyZolcman/d1da20bc76fb808cfa9575197aac9d88) in which he again wishes death in response to objective criticism, and (according to him) pays money to some "buddhist" temple to pray for the call of dеаth to all those who criticize him.

5) Finally, take a look at this [commit](https://web.archive.org/web/20220730180752/https://github.com/synrc/n2o/commit/9dc7514f4a57abb0f6b43cb56a1c5d37c80b09f3) and this [blogpost](http://www.ostinelli.net/misultin-erlang-and-websockets/) 

Overall, if you look closely at all of his activities, you can conclude that his skills are mostly limited to basic frontend development and graphic design. And this is easily confirmed if you explore the commits he makes to the many projects he has appropriated by erasing the original authorship.

Usually, these commits are very small and there are a lot of them.
He do this to make an illusion of big contribution to these projects.

In addition, [the large number of meaningless commits](https://github.com/5HT/5HT/commits/master?after=219023c1880fac99fa347b6192445a4314ae533e+34&branch=master&qualified_name=refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster) puts him [at the top of GitHub users from Ukraine](https://github.com/gayanvoice/top-github-users/blob/main/markdown/public_contributions/ukraine.md), something he is incredibly proud of.

As I have written before, this man is absolutely immoral. 

He is very fond of scolding everyone for their lack of ethics, but his behavior is not even close to ethical. He [calls himself a non-binary person](https://tonpa.guru/stream/2022/2022-04-10%20Russian%20War%20against%20Groupoid%20Infinity.htm), but in his Twitter account [he acts as a transphobe](https://archive.fo/d6BnB), which is not surprising for the far-right nationalist that he is.

I find it sad that there are such immoral, insensitive people in the open source community like @5HT, who are ready to do anything for fame and money.
